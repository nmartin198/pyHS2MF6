Welcome to the pyHS2MF6 documentation!
======================================

pyHS2MF6 is an integrated hydrologic model created using a dynamic 
coupling of the Hydrological Simulation Program â€“ FORTRAN (HSPF) and 
MODFLOW 6 in Python. The coupling is dynamic because HSPF and MODFLOW 
6 exchange information during each simulation time step. At this time,
pyHS2MF6 can only use and simulate the basic water movement and storage 
processes in HSPF and MODFLOW.

A fundamental goal in the design of pyHS2MF6 was to provide for the 
ability to build on existing, independently created, HSPF and MODFLOW 
models. Consequently, pyHS2MF6 provides two simulation modes.

1. Coupled mode: Provides a dynamically coupled simulation with a
   one day time step where HSPF simulates watershed and stream 
   routing processes first and then sends simulated infiltration
   to MODFLOW for MODFLOW to use in its simulation of the current
   day. When MODFLOW finishes simulating the day, it sends 
   simulated groundwater discharge to the land surface back
   to HSPF. HSPF uses the groundwater discharge in its simulation 
   of the next day.

2. Standalone mode: Is included purely so that the user can check or 
   verify the function of the independent, existing model (either
   HSPF or MODFLOW 6) in pyHS2MF6. It is not recommended to use 
   pyHS2MF6 standalone mode in place of just using HSPF or just 
   using MODFLOW 6.

pyHS2MF6 is available for free under the 
`GNU Affero General Public License version 3 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html>`_  
and without warranty or support. Technical support, however, can be 
arranged, if desired. pyHS2MF6 builds upon and extends two 
independent models and provides for dynamic information exchange 
between the models. As a result, pyHS2MF6 configuration, implementation,
and use requires a number of prerequisites.

Please see :ref:`getting_started` before trying to install and run 
pyHS2MF6. And, it is recommended to at least browse through the 
:ref:`case_study` before trying to apply pyHS2MF6 to a specific site.
