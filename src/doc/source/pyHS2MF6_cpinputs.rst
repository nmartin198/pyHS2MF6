Coupled Mode Inputs
-------------------------------

Special inputs are only required for coupled mode simulation. The special 
inputs include a text format input file that tells **pyHS2MF6** where 
to find the two models and where to find the spatial mapping dictionaries.
Mapping dictionaries provide the means to translate between the lumped 
parameter **HSPF** representation and the **MODFLOW 6** three-dimensional 
computational grid representation.
