Coupled Model Controller and Queue Server
==========================================

The coupled model controller and queue server also includes the main 
functionality to run each of mHSP2 and pyMF6 in standalone mode. Standalone 
mode is really only for model checking and verification. Consequently, the
focus of this component is on coupled model simulations.
