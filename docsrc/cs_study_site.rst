Study Site
===========

The case study site is the The 471 km\ :sup:`2` :ref:`fig_cs_watershed` in Val 
Verde County, TX, USA. 
`USGS Gage 08449100 <https://waterdata.usgs.gov/tx/nwis/uv/?site_no=08449100&PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060>`_ 
is located on Dolan Creek near the watershed outlet and the confluence of 
Dolan Creek and Devils River.

In terms of surficial geology, Dolan Creek watershed is at the 
southwestern margin of the Edwards Plateau, a resistant carbonate 
upland of nearly flat-lying limestone and dolostone with thin 
soils, caprock mesas and dry arroyos (Barker et al., 1994). Dolan 
Springs and three other mapped springs, in or near the site watershed, 
are located on an outcrop of the Fort Terrett limestone of the Edwards 
Formation. The hypothesis is that the Fort Terrett is relatively 
impermeable and spring discharge occurs at or associated with the 
contact of the Fort Terrett and overlying material. The majority of 
the watershed has Segovia limestone of the Edwards Formation mapped 
at the surface with the exception of a few ridgetops mapped as Buda 
limestone of the Edwards Formation.

    **Dolan Creek watershed**

This stream gauging station has been in operation since November 2011. As shown 
on :ref:`fig_cs_focused_ws`, most of Dolan Creek is ephemeral with the exception of the 
downstream-most reach where a number of springs, including Dolan Springs, 
provide flow to the stream throughout the year.
