 Code Documentation
==========================

The code base is composed of two independent programs and a coupled model 
and message passing queue management framework. The two programs and the
manager all execute in independent processes. **Figure** 
:ref:`fig_cd_3procframe` provides a schematic showing the interaction of 
the three independent processes and the components of the coupled 
controller and queue server.


* One independent program is **mHSP2** which provides a Python variant of 
  :abbr:`HSPF (Hydrological Simulation Program â€“ FORTRAN)`.

* The other program is **pyMF6** which provides a Python-wrapped version
  of MODFLOW 6.

    **pyHS2MF6 framework and queues**

Coupled model simulation relies on three message passing queues to 
transmit information among :ref:`pyMF6`, :ref:`mHSP2`, and the Coupled 
Controller and Queue Server. Spatial mapping, specified by the user as 
part of coupled model inputs, tells mHSP2 how to map to and from the 
MODFLOW 6 model grid.
